== Description ==

The extension replace all Google Maps functionality with that of OpenStreetMap, including map displays on single event pages, and Events Calendar PRO's Map View, and single venue pages.

This extension requires the [Leaflet Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/leaflet-map/) plugin. Special thanks to Gerd Weyhing for the [inspiration](https://woyng.com/the-events-calendar-mit-openstreetmaps-statt-google-maps/).

Note: This extension doesn't yet support venue geocoding.
