The extension replaces most of the Google Maps functionality with that of OpenStreetMap, including map displays on single event pages, and Events Calendar PRO's Map View, and single venue pages.

== Description ==

The extension replace all Google Maps functionality with that of OpenStreetMap, including map displays on single event pages, and Events Calendar PRO's Map View, and single venue pages.

This extension requires the [Leaflet Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/leaflet-map/) plugin. Special thanks to Gerd Weyhing for the [inspiration](https://woyng.com/the-events-calendar-mit-openstreetmaps-statt-google-maps/).

Warning: your own template overrides for `modules/map.php` and `pro/map/gmap-container.php` won't work.

Note 1: This extension doesn't yet support venue geocoding. You can still use a Google Maps API key for that, which you have to enter at Events > Settings > APIs.

Note 2: This extension works only with the 'classic' views. As you might have heard we are redesigning the calendar views. This extension does not yet support the new views, which are in beta phase at the time of publishing.

== Installation ==

Install and activate like any other plugin!

* You can upload the plugin zip file via the *Plugins â€£ Add New* screen
* You can unzip the plugin and then upload to your plugin directory (typically _wp-content/plugins_) via FTP
* Once it has been installed or uploaded, simply visit the main plugin list and activate it
